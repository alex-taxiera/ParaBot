# ParaBot
A discord bot built to interface with Epic Games' Paragon API.

## The API
Epic Games has closed Paragon, also shutting down the API, I am hosting my own version of the API at www.paragoneapi.com ([example](www.paragoneapi.com/v1/heroes/summary/murdock)) with data I downloaded from the original API
## Self Hosting
If you want to run this bot, it utilizes my [eris-boiler](https://github.com/alex-taxiera/eris-boiler), follow the instructions for how to set it up there.
